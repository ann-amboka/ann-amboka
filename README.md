# Ann Amboka Amukasah ✨

## **Hello, I’m Ann — Product,Marketing Strategist & Data Analytics Enthusiast (Customer‑Centric, Insight‑Driven)**

I design insight-driven strategies, craft **high‑impact product narratives**, and turn messy data into **clear, profitable decisions**. My world sits at the crossroads of **marketing, product, analytics, and automation** — where customer psychology, strategy, and storytelling intersect.

I’m currently transitioning deeper into **tech and data**, blending my 6+ years of experience in:
**Product Marketing • Digital Marketing • CRM • Data Analysis (Excel, SQL) • Strategic Partnerships • Customer Experience • Market Research**

I’m fascinated by how products scale, how users behave, and how data whispers the truth beneath the noise.
